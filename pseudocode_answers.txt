Short Answer 
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	To organize and set up the logic without getting distracted about remembering and 	following all the syntax correctly.
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
	Since pseudocode is to be read by humans, computers cannot process it. 

Programming Assignment 
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
	function a, b 
	if a is greater than or equal to b ? 
	  return a 
	else 
	  return b	

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
	create a variable that is 0
	for loop 
	  i starts at 1 till 100, i increments 
	  the variable equals and adds i 
	  return a 	

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
	(assuming the phonebook is an array that has a collection of objects with 2 properties: full name and phone number in full name's alphabetically order) 
	create a variable that is array
	create a variable that is the specific entry
	function
	    iterate through the phonebook array with filter method 
	    create a variable that equals to the object whose full name is identical with the specific entry 
	    return the variable 	

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

---------------------------
	function(a, b){
    	  (a >=b) ? a : b
	}

---------------------------
	var a = 0;
  	for(let i=0; i<=100; i++){
    	  a += i;
     	  console.log(a);
  	}
---------------------------
	var phonebook = []
	var query = ""
	function(query, phonebook){
  	  let result = phonebook.filter(a => a.fullname == query)
  	  return result
	}
